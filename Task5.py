import math #importing the math library so i can use pi to find the area of a cirlce
r = 52 #setting the vaslue of a variable names r to 52, this represents the radius
area = math.pi * (r * r) #using math.pi and brackets to make the equation to find the area of a cirlce

print("A circle with radius {0} has an area of {1}".format(r,area)) #using the format method to put my variables into the print function in the correct order
